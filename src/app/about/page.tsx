        <p>
          Hi, Iâ€™m Suresh Thapa, a dedicated MERN stack developer with a passion
          for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications. With a strong
          foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in
          building responsive and scalable web solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently completed a MERN stack course and have since applied my
          skills in several hands-on projects, including a Fiverr clone and an
          e-commerce website. My expertise spans across technologies like
          MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, allowing me to
          craft efficient and modern web applications.
