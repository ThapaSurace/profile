          <p>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Suresh Thapa, a dedicated MERN stack developer with a
            passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
            With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I
            specialize in building responsive and scalable web solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently completed a MERN stack course and have since applied my
            skills in several hands-on projects, including a Fiverr clone and an
            e-commerce website. My expertise spans across technologies like
            MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, allowing me
            to craft efficient and modern web applications.
          </p>
