              Hi, Iâ€™m Suresh Thapa, a dedicated MERN stack developer with a
              passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
              With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, I
              specialize in building responsive and scalable web solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
              I recently completed a MERN stack course and have since applied my
              skills in several hands-on projects, including a Fiverr clone and
              an e-commerce website. My expertise spans across technologies like
              MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, allowing me
              to craft efficient and modern web applications.
